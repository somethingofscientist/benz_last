These desiccants stand out due to their exceptional features and properties, making them a top choice for safeguarding your products. BE DRY Desiccant Bags are specifically developed for the use in automobile and engineering industry to protect goods from damage caused by moisture during transit and storage. These desiccant bags are made up of calcium chloride which can adsorb large amounts of moisture to protect goods in boxes, ferrous and non-ferrous products from rusting by reducing the relative humidity and keeping it below the critical dew point.",

            image_text2: "BE DRY Desiccant Bags contain a specially developed moisture adsorbent that can adsorb more than 250% of their own weight and enclose moisture. These desiccants can also be used as container desiccants and can be supplied in chain form. BE DRY Desiccant Bags have highly efficient protection which also works against “Container Rain”, which occurs due to condensation."
